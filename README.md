# Description

This study addresses the challenges of identifying and understanding the level of radicalization in recommendation videos by introducing an indicator that reflects various aspects of video attributes and
user behaviours. The introduced pipeline combines explainable artificial intelligence techniques and prediction
modeling to evaluate the potential of the introduced indicator for determining diversity within recommendation lists of up-next videos. Experimental results show the influence of video attributes on choosing radicalized up-next videos, that often leads to form radicalization paths in recommendation networks. Further experiments demonstrate the approach potential in predicting diversity levels within recommendation lists by incorporating identified factors with user watching history. Determining diversity is an early step for helping to mitigate radicalization, and detecting its presence within recommendation systems.
